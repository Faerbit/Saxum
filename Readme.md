This is a Marble Puzzle/Exploration Game developed in the practical course
at the institute for Computer Graphics and Multimedia at the RWTH Aachen.

##Downloads
See [release page](https://github.com/Faerbit/Saxum/releases) for downloads(Cooming soon(tm)).

##Controls
You can control the camera by moving the mouse. You can zoom with the mouse wheel.
The marble is controlled via the W,A,S and D keys. 
To exit the game press escape.
The controls are also listed listed on the loading screen.

##Building
Currently only tested on Linux. To build execute build.sh. Resulting binary will be in binaries.
You can also use the run.sh script to directly start the binary after building it.

## OS X support
In theory this should also compile on OS X. Since I do not own a Mac it is impossible for me to test this.
If you get it compiling, please get in touch with me afterwards.

##Modding
In theory the game is highly moddable. If you're interested in this, please get in touch with me, 
so I can explain the workflow to you.
